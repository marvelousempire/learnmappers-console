## Trustee Quick Start (Plain English)

- **Open it**: Start **Quick Server**, then open **`/learnmappers-console`** on the same address/port as Quick Server (check the terminal “Main:” line).
- **What you do**: Browse services and records, and open the pages you need from the tabs.
- **If you see a login screen**: Sign in. If you are locked out, ask the system operator to add access.
